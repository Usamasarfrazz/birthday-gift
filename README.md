This is a romantic single-page experience built with the [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) together with Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and TypeScript to share a heartfelt birthday message.

## Getting started

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and enjoy the animated love letter.

The layout draws on Playfair Display and Inter through `next/font`, gentle gradients from Tailwind, and rolling Framer Motion transitions for the hero, cards, and surprise reveal.

## Deployment

1. Commit your changes and push to your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
2. Visit [https://vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) and import the repository.
3. Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js App Router, run `npm install`, and build with `npm run build`.
4. After deployment, you will have a shareable romantic page ready for Hafsa.
